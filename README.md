# Orbital Drift

The game prototype I hope to begin during Devtober 2020 and to finish later on.

It tends to be a Paper Please like in which you play as the admin operator of a space station. You have to take care of
the supplies, the oxygen levels, the systems, the passengers, the docks, the communications and so on, on your 
dashboard. To make the station prosper and survive, you'll have to face difficult choices.

## 3C

It's a management-strategy game.

### Character

The player sees the "administration table" of the station

### Control

### Camera

The camera doesn't move

## Plateform

PC first. The game is mainly handled with mice though and could be easily adapted to mobile phone in the future.

## Target

## USP
